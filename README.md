# Registripe - Ticket Selection

Enables selecting more than just attendees for a registration: groups for example.

 * Create / edit ticket selections.
 * Navigate through selections.
 * Create + link attendees to selections.
 * Select numbers of each ticket type
 * Fill out details, and special details in a sequence
 * Special calculations

## TODO

 * Server side validation failure removes form content
 * Display price estimate/summary.
 * Back button.
 * Prevent invalid submissions.
 * Ensure attendees are deleted when selections are deleted

 * Navigating backwards through selections doesn't go to end of group
